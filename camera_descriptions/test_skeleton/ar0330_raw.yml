      additional delay allows the user to increase the setup or hold time at the receiver
      circuits and can be used to compensate for skew introduced in PCB design.  If
      the DLL timing adjustment is not required, the data and clock lane delay settings
      should be set to a default code of 0x000 to reduce jitter, skew, and power dissipation.
